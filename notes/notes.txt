* website vs web application
    website is a collection of web pages that are linked together and can be accessed via the internet
    web application is a software application that is accessed via a web browser (multiple components)

* components save the repitition of code
    components are reusable pieces of code that can be used in multiple places
    components are used to create a web application

* npx uses the cli and create the react app instead of installing create-react-app globally
    npx is a package runner that comes with npm
    npx is used to run create-react-app without installing it globally


* Two types of components
    class components
    functional components

* can access variables in react html (jsx) using curly braces

* change extension of file to .jsx to use jsx (using React javascript library)

* use empty tag if you want to return more than one element
    <>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>         
    </>

* empty tag is same as React.Fragment (import React, { Fragment } from 'react';)
    <Fragment>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
    </Fragment>

* can export default only one component
    export default App;

* to export multiple components from single file
    export { App, About, Contact }

* Similarly , can only be imported in carly braces
    import { App, About } from './components/App';

* export default can imported by any name. 
    import Huehue from './components/App';
    where App is the name of the component which is exported as default
